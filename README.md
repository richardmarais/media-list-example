Tech Stack: Angular 7 or 8 + TypeScript + RxJS

Description: The purpose of this exercise is to check the knowledge of using Typescript, RxJS and Angular. 
As a result, we should receive a working example of the features listed above. 
The list item is a media item that can be either image, document, video or audio. User should be able to filter the list by these options. 
User should be able to live search the list items which means search needs to be triggered on every keystroke. Search only by itemâ€™s title.
The clear button should reset all the applied filters and search queries and display the default list view.
Order button orders the list either ascendingly or descendingly.
UI and styling are not important in this case, just prepare something quick and simple. Bootstrap is OK.
